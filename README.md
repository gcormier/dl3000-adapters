# Banana Jack and BNC Adapters for RIGOL DL3000 Electronic Loads

## Overview

This project is about banana jack and BNC adapters for RIGOL's DL3000 series
electronic loads. There are already adapters for narrower binding posts (like
BK Precision, ...) but I did not find any for the 39 mm pitch of the RIGOL
DL3000 series.

These adapters are meant for conveniently feeding a few amperes - not for high
current applications.
